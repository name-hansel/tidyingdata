## GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT

This repository was created for the course project of the coursera's Getting and cleaning Data course.
The final product of this project is a independent, tidied dataset comprising of mean and standard deviation, created from untidy datasets provided in txt format.

## STEPS DONE IN THIS PROJECT

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
